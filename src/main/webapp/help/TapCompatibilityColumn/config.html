<div>
    This column provides quick information on test result compatibility with another job. <br/>
  In order to be able to leverage this feature, you need to stick with a simple name convention,
  where corresponding jobs follow certain naming pattern. <br/>
  You could e.g. have the following jobs:
  <table>
      <tr><th>job name</th><th>description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>FeatureA-nightly</td><td>test for feature A running on your nightly builds</td></tr>
      <tr><td>FeatureB-nightly</td><td>test for feature B running on your nightly builds</td></tr>
      <tr><td>FeatureA-golden</td><td>build that generates golden (desired, probably made up) result TAP file, for feature A</td></tr>
      <tr><td>FeatureB-golden</td><td>dtto (golden file generator) for feature B</td></tr>
  </table>
  Then to quickly see if your nightly builds are compatible with desired results, simply add this column and set <code>nightly</code> to be replaced with <code>golden</code> in the following form:
